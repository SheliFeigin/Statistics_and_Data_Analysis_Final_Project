# Statistics_and_Data_Analysis_Final_Project
By: Sheli Feigin and Daniel Yohan

This project was completed during an Intro to Statistics and Data Analysis with R course at "Digital Sciences for High-Tech" degree program at Tel Aviv University

The goal of the project was to demonstrate and practice the different elements which are a part of most data analysis/data science projects.
In this project we handled the different phases of a data analysis project: data import, data tidying, transforming variables, visualizing and modelling (hypothesis testing, regression, analysis of variance).

Our project is based on a data from “Kaggle”: “flavors of cacao”. This data set was created to list the different characteristics in chocolate making around the world and analyze the data to find interesting facts. 

The project is in RStudio with R.
